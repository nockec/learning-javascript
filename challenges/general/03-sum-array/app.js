CHALLENGE: Create a function that filters out negative numbers
    
		You can create your own array of numbers but consider trying this problem
		with a few different sets to verify your solution. Have one array with
		negative and positive numbers and another with integers and decimals.

		You could also try using arrays of different lengths. If you're feeling
		comfortable with this, try learning about higher order functions like
		reduce in the resources section below.
