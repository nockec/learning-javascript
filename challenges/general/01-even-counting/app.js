CHALLENGE: Output all even numbers from 0 â€“ 10
    
    Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible. 
    Consider using loops that would allow you to type the fewest characters/commands. 
    While you could simply print the even numbers, get creative and see how you could 
    output them in a way that would work up to 10 or even up to 10,000 with little 
    extra effort.

// your code will start here.

for(let n = 0;n<=100;n+=2){
    output.append(n);
