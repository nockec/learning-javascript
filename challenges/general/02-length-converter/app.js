CHALLENGE: Create a length converter function
    
	Creating a function is a skill that'll be useful in many settings, and as 
	you progress, you'll be working on much more complicated functions than this 
	one. But a function that converts units of measure can be pretty handy in 
	multiple professions and industries.

	Let's start with a conversion from kilometers to miles. The function should
	include the input in kilometers and return the answer in miles.

	formula is: miles = kilometers / 1.609

//@ts-check
export {};
/** @type {HTMLPreElement} */ //@ts-ignore
const output = document.getElementById("output-container");

// your code will start here.

for(let input = 1;//this is the input for the number you want to convert 
	 input/1.609;){
    console.log(input);
};
